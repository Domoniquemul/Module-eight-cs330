How do I approach designing software?
I first look at what is the goal of design to determine the functinality and how to support it.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skills I have learn is understanding java better taking a new approach to designing shape in structers. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
the proccess I took is first looking at requirements. Editing the code and as well excaming the files. 

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
The tactics I used will be used in future work by allowing to really examine any issues that will come about. 

How do I approach developing programs?
The developing approach is first understanding the code it self.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The stragies I used to work on the 3D scence was try to understand the vertices and indices of the shapes. 
How did iteration factor into your development? Because most standards to create the shapes are the same when input the vertices. 
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? My approach is more open to understand the assigment in goal of the projects. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? As a software tester insprining to be a programmer I belive theses are stepping stones for that.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The graphics and visualizations of the knoweledge and skills will be applied in furture is understanding mesurements alot netter and how shading can affect the objects.  
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway? It gives me knowledge by having a deeper understanding of how grapic desinging work.
